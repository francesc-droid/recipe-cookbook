## Project Goals
The purpose of this website is to allow users to share and search for recipes from any cultural background, for any taste, dietary requirements, budget, timespan or occasion.  
The user will be able to show support, and give input on another user's recipe through the "like" and "comment" features.  
The website is meant to widen the users's perception, both culturally and culinarily, through the open source and social nature of the website.
